### Freecodecamp forum page views time-series data analysis

In this project we will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. The dataset contains the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. We will try to find the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Date | Date from when the views are collected |
| Value | Forum Page views |
